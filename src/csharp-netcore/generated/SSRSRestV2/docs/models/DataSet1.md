# SSRSRestV2.Model.DataSet1
The DataSet object is derived from the abstract type CatalogItem and therefore contains all of its properties. This object specifies the information needed to supply a set of data to a report. It is analogous to a view in a database and can include a data source pointer, a query definition, and optional parameter values, calculated fields, and filtering and collation information.
